## Background

### Overview

Project Fortis is a data ingestion, analysis and visualization pipeline.Â The
Fortis pipeline collects social media conversations and postings from the public
web and darknet data sources.

Learn more about Fortis in our [article](https://aka.ms/fortis-story) and in our
[dashboard walkthrough (in Spanish)](http://aka.ms/fortis-colombia-demo).

### Monitoring

Fortis is a flexible project and can be configured for many situations, e.g.:
* Ingesting from multiple data sources, including:
  - Twitter
  - Facebook
  - Public Web (via Bing)
  - RSS
  - Reddit
  - Instagram
  - Radio Broadcasts
  - ACLED
* Fortis also comes with pre-configured terms to monitor sites of these types:
  - Humanitarian
  - Climate Change
  - Health

### Architecture

## Deployment

### Local deployment

#### One-time setup

First, you need to get the code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis.git
cd project-fortis
```

Then, you need to set up some services in Azure by running the following Bash
script (e.g. via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)):

```sh
./project-fortis-pipeline/localdeploy/fortis-deploy.sh \
  -i YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE \
  -l YOUR_CLOSEST_AZURE_LOCATION_HERE \
  -o .env-secrets
```

This script will deploy to Azure a number of services used by Fortis, such as
ServiceBus, EventHubs, Cognitive Services, and so forth. The secrets to access
these services are stored in a `.env-secrets` file which the rest of the
development setup will leverage. All the services are stored inside of a single
resource group whose name is stored under the `FORTIS_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` key
in the secrets file.

Next, you need to create a Mapbox access token. If you don't have one yet, you
can create a new one for free by [signing up](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/).
Once you have the token, append it to the `.env-secrets` file like so:

```
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
```

You may also want to add your email address to the `USERS` or `ADMINS` list in
the `.env` file; otherwise you wouldn't be able to log into your Fortis site!
Alternatively, you can also clear out the value for the key `AD_CLIENT_ID` in
the `.env` file in order to disable authentication entirely. This is for example
useful if you want to talk directly to the GraphQL server via the GraphiQL tool
instead of accessing the API endpoints via the UI.

#### Preparing Docker

This project runs entirely inside of Docker containers orchestrated by
docker-compose, so please ensure that you have installed Docker on your system,
e.g. [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

We're using a volume mount to enable support for code hot-reload. As such,
please ensure that you've shared the drive on which your code resides with
Docker via the "Shared Drives" tab in the [Docker settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#docker-settings).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/34893261-6b615fca-f7aa-11e7-80bc-833ee2d8c9a7.png"
     title="Example 'Shared Drives' Docker settings for a Fortis developer who has the project-fortis code on the C: drive"
     height="400" />

The containers created for this project use quite a lot of resources, so if any
of the services die with exit code 137, please give more memory to Docker via
the "Advanced" tab in the [Docker settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#docker-settings).

#### Running the service

Now you can start the full Fortis pipeline with one command:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all the Docker services and gather logs in the terminal. After
all the Docker services started, head over to the following URLs to play with
the services:

* Frontend
  - http://localhost:8888/#/site/Fortis%20Dev/admin
  - http://localhost:8888/#/site/Fortis%20Dev
* Backend
  - http://localhost:8889/api/edges/graphiql
  - http://localhost:8889/api/messages/graphiql
  - http://localhost:8889/api/settings/graphiql
  - http://localhost:8889/api/tiles/graphiql
* Spark
  - http://localhost:7777/jobs/

After making changes, you can re-build and re-start the affected services using:

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Note that any changes to the React code in project-fortis-interfaces folder will
be automatically detected and re-loaded so the re-build step above won't be
necessary for changes to the frontend.

#### Accessing Cassandra

If you need more low-level access to the Cassandra database, you can execute the
following command to log into a CQL shell:

```
docker-compose exec project_fortis_services /app/cqlsh
```

### Production deployment

#### Prerequisites

* First and foremost, you'll need an Azure subscription. You can create one for
  free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

* Generate an SSH key pair following [these](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
  instructions. The contents from the generated `MyKey.pub` file will be used
  for the `SSH Public Key` field in the Azure deployment.

* You'll need an Azure service principal. You can follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal)
  if you need to generate a new service principal. During the Azure deployment,
  the `Application ID` will be used for the `Service Principal App ID` field
  and the `Authentication Key` will be used for the `Service Principal App Key`.

* You'll need a Mapbox access token. If you don't have one yet, [sign up](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/)
  to create a new token for free.

#### Setting up a new Azure deployment

Hit the deploy to Azure button below:

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.svg)](https://deploy.azure.com/?repository=https://github.com/catalystcode/project-fortis/tree/master?ptmpl=azuredeploy.parameters.json)

Fill in the wizard that comes up:

![Screenshot of ARM wizard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7635865/27882830-e785819c-6193-11e7-9b27-5fc452f23b1a.png)

Now grab a large cup of coffee as the deployment can take north of an hour to
complete.

Once the deployment has finished, click on the `Manage your resources`
(highlighted below).

![Screenshot of ARM template after successful deployment with highlight of management link to access the newly created resource group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/33331326-4437a7fe-d42f-11e7-8b4a-19b968b4705b.png)

Now click on the `Tags` tab in the Azure Portal (highlighted below) and find the
`FORTIS_ADMIN_INTERFACE_URL` (also highlighted below).

![Screenshot of Azure portal with highlight of the Fortis admin site URL accessed via Azure Portal tags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/33331249-1b1ce1f4-d42f-11e7-8341-0100660e9e74.png)

Point your browser to the admin interface URL. Once the Fortis admin portal
loads, you can now finalize the setup of your Fortis deployment using the portal:

![Screenshot showing the Fortis admin interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/33331562-e9e589be-d42f-11e7-870c-6b758ec2141a.png)

Once you've completed all the admin configuration, your deployment is ready to
be used.

For more detailed information on the admin page, refer to this [guide](project-fortis-pipeline/docs/user/admin.md).
